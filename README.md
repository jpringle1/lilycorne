SETUP:
- setup-vars.sh
- setup-container.sh
- enter-container.sh

TODO:
Currently in the process of automating the debug process by extrating everything into scripts.
- Next, i need to find a way to pass the env variables i exported in setup-vars.sh into the docker container
- Then, find a way to set the build command to an alias in the container
